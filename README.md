## A Ulysses export style to mimic the 'Academic Report' template in Apple Pages

----

A Ulysses style that closely matches the “Academic Report” template provided by Apple in their Pages application.

I loved using Ulysses for all my academic writing, but I always found myself copying the work to Pages before submitting, so I created a template to match what I usually styled it like from Pages.

I started from Ulysses’s included “Academia” template, but much has changed.

### Quick Start

#### Page Numbers
Make sure to change the `$last-name` variable from 'Van Halen' to yours.

#### Title Page:

1. Start your document with an `H1`, this is the title.
2. For a subtitle, use an `H2`.
3. Use a comment block for your name and any other attribution you would like to include.
4. Put a divider (4 dashes) after your last line of attribution, and start your next page with an `H2`.

#### Using References / Works Cited:
For APA and MLA style references, use `H5` to create a References or Works Cited page, respectively. Then, use `H6` for each citation. I find it best to paste into Ulysses using CMD + Shift + V and selecting HTML or Rich Text for pasting. I primarily use APA and this seems to work.

### Notes:
This is by no means a finished product, and I’m sure I will encounter many issues, and I’ll do my best to fix them upon discovery. If you have a suggestion or notice a problem, please submit an issue!

Currently, you pretty much use this **exactly** as described to have this template behave itself.
